<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Farida. I am a budding software engineer who is always looking to learn and grow. I completed my undergrad degree in Biology at McGill University,
  back when I thought I wanted to pursue a career in neuroscience research. After working in labs for three years and finally addressing my deep denial
  of disliking lab work, I decided I didn't want to continue on in a career in biology. With the guidance of friends in data science careers, I transitioned
  into a career as a Data Analyst by taking math, computer science, and economics courses. Within the span of 6 months, I learned how to program in Python and
  SQL, and complete end to end projects that took data through the entire data pipeline. I even participated in and won the Google Challenge category at my
  first hackathon (and got free backpacks)!
  </p>

<p>I'm now looking to continue growing and challenging myself by entering the field of software engineering. I want to focus on building quality products, being closer to
  the core work of an organization, and providing excellent experiences for users. If you want to connect and chat with me, please book a time in
  my <a href="https://calendly.com/faridarahman">calendar</a>. Otherwise, feel free to take a look around at the projects displayed in this portfolio!</p>
