<h1>The Best Movies According to Farida</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favourite movies currently.</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
<p>Obviously the top choice. This hits on so many genres and manages to be funny at the same time as wildly emotional and intimate.</p>
<h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
<p>A bit of a snooty classic but still one of my favourites.</p>
<h3>The Big Short</h3>
<p>Everything I love in one film.</p>
